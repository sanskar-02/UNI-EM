                    Every second counts in a cardiac emergency. When a heart goes into ventricular fibrillation (VF),
                    its chaotic rhythm disrupts blood flow, depriving vital organs of oxygen. That's where UNI-EM
                    Biphasic Defibrillator steps in, delivering a life-saving jolt to restore a normal rhythm and give
                    hope back to critical situations.

                        <!-- <h4>Key Features :</h4> -->
                        <p>Unlike traditional monophasic defibrillators, our biphasic technology delivers a biphasic
                            waveform, meaning the electrical current flows in two directions instead of one. This
                            innovative approach offers several advantages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased defibrillation success rate: Biphasic waveforms require lower energy, yet
                                effectively depolarize cardiac cells, leading to a higher rate of successful
                                defibrillation on the first shock.


                            </li>
                            <li>Reduced tissue damage: The biphasic waveform minimizes muscle contractions, leading to
                                less damage to the heart tissue compared to monophasic shocks.</li>
                            <li>
                                Improved patient outcomes: Studies have shown that biphasic defibrillation can lead to
                                improved long-term survival rates for patients experiencing VF.</li>
