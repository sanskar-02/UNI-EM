                                Water vapour at 41°C is as effective as
                                aerosol therapy in reducing allergic

        <p>AcquathermTM is an innovative system manufactured by
            Shreeyash for the first time in the medical history,
            which can deliver high flows of Air or Oxygen ranging from
            1 to 15 LPM. The high flows of gases are warmed at body
            temperature & are humidified up to 99 to 100% relative
            humidity & are delivered via nasal Cannula.
            Importance of Heat and Humidity :
            Heat and Humidity prevents airway water loss, airway
            cooling, thickened secretions, nasal irritation & bleeding.
            AcquathermTM allows delivery of breathing gases heated
            to body temperature & at nearly 100% relative humidity
            by Cannula without drying or cooling the airway.
